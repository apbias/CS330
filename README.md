REFLECTION

How do I approach designing software?

When I design software, planning and breaking down requirements into manageable components has allowed me to develop and refine each aspect of the project with effeciency. The benefits of this approach is that I am able to incorporate feedback and testing with ease. The modular design approach is great for scaling while also be maintainable.  

How do I approach developing programs?

My approach to developing programs is having clear defined requirements and breaking down them down in the planning stage so that I am able to develop each component systematically. For 3d scene, I was able to work on each part (basic shapes, colors and textures, camera controls and lighting) step by step, ensuring that each element was fully integrated and functioning before moving on to the next, which helped me manage complexity and maintain a clear development flow. Iteration also played a crucial role in my development approach, allowing me to refine each element after integrating and testing it within the overall scene, ensuring that all components worked together.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

The project from this course has strengthened my problem solving (debugging) and creative thinking. The creative thinking was the biggest takeaway in this course has you had to bring all the components together to create a great 3d scene. The skills in this course has prepared me for future courses in my academic career as I pursue my degree in computer science.
